# Game-Experiments
## Experimenting with various data structures &amp; code for an trading game. 

**This is a for-fun and practice project. Undecided language/format.**

1. Current classroom experience (05302022) is in C#, Windows Forms, and C++. Content may be a mix of these and/or other languages.
2. Development of this content will most likely be erratic and irregular due to schedule conflicts.
3. Author is still experimenting with GitHub and Visual Studio as a whole. Feedback regarding usage is appreciated.


#### **Game Details & Synopsis**
- Tentative Working Title: A Merchant of Geminaria
- Working Synopsis: You are a merchant trying to make enough money to retire to the place of your choosing. You have limited capital to start, which you must leverage to buy goods and sell at profit.
- Basic Mechanics:  
   
  - Player can choose level of difficulty, which affects the amount of money needed to retire. (possibly also affect how many times player can 'cycle' through the interactions at each marketplace? For example, at hard difficulty, they will be able to go through stalls 1 time each for sell and purchase, with or without knowing what other stalls are available. Then must go somewhere else before they can come back to shop at that particular marketplace again).
  - Travel to various cities/places to purchase various goods and attempt to sell for profit.
  - Mild CYOA options (selection of cities and travel options based on where they are).
  - No limit to quantity they can purchase (no limit to carrying capacity)

- Ideas for Advanced Mechanics:  
   - Level of difficulty also affects starting items (carrying capacity, beginning capital) and luck (on the road events, probability of good or bad fortune, perhaps whether the player can be killed?)
   - Bank feature, where different areas use different forms of money that must be exchanged before they can be used in certain places (example of currency in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt; player can find/accumulate currency in Nilfgaardian florens and Temerian orens, but useable currency is only Novigrad crowns). Possibility of changes with exchange rates depending on place/time?
   - Various options (based on difficulty level?) to increase carrying capacity.
   - Pets/companions to have added skill benefits and/or increase carrying capacity.
